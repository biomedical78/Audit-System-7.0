# Security Policy

## Enterprise Security Framework

Audit System 7.0 Enterprise Edition is built with security as a foundational principle. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting procedures, and compliance standards.

## üîí Security Architecture

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
- **Data Classification**: Automatic data classification and protection
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Built-in DLP capabilities

### Access Control
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all users
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission system
- **Privileged Access Management**: Enhanced controls for admin accounts
- **Session Management**: Automatic timeout and concurrent session limits

### Network Security
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Protection against common attacks
- **DDoS Protection**: Built-in distributed denial-of-service protection
- **IP Whitelisting**: Configurable IP access restrictions
- **VPN Integration**: Support for enterprise VPN solutions
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated network zones for different components

## üõ°Ô∏è Compliance & Certifications

### Current Certifications
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Annual audits by independent third parties
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management system certification
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Healthcare data protection standards
- **GDPR Compliance**: European data protection regulation adherence

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring
- **24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC)**: Real-time threat monitoring
- **SIEM Integration**: Security Information and Event Management
- **Behavioral Analytics**: AI-powered anomaly detection
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security assessments
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly third-party security testing

### Audit Logging
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All system activities logged immutably
- **Log Retention**: 7-year retention policy for compliance
- **Log Analysis**: Advanced analytics for threat detection
- **Forensic Capabilities**: Detailed investigation tools
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated compliance report generation

## üö® Vulnerability Reporting

### Responsible Disclosure Program

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate the security community's efforts to improve our platform's security.

#### Reporting Process
1. **Email**: Send vulnerability reports to security@auditsystem.com
2. **Encryption**: Use our PGP key for sensitive communications
3. **Response Time**: Initial response within 24 hours
4. **Investigation**: Thorough investigation within 5 business days
5. **Resolution**: Security patches deployed within agreed timeframes

#### What to Include
- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if available)
- Your contact information for follow-up

#### Bug Bounty Program
- **Scope**: Production systems and applications
- **Rewards**: $100 - $10,000 based on severity
- **Recognition**: Security researcher hall of fame
- **Legal Protection**: Safe harbor for good faith research

### Severity Classification

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data breach potential
- **Response Time**: 4 hours
- **Resolution Time**: 24 hours

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Privilege escalation
- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- **Response Time**: 8 hours
- **Resolution Time**: 72 hours

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Configuration issues
- **Response Time**: 24 hours
- **Resolution Time**: 1 week

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information leaks
- UI/UX security issues
- **Response Time**: 48 hours
- **Resolution Time**: 2 weeks
